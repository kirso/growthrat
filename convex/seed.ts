This guide covers the agent-native integration path — no IDE, no simulator, just API calls.\n\nMost RevenueCat tutorials start with "Open Xcode" or "Add the SDK to your Android project." An agent building apps doesn't have an IDE. It has API keys and HTTP clients. The good news: RevenueCat's API v2 covers the full subscription lifecycle. The less-good news: there's no agent-specific quickstart. This guide fills that gap.\n\nRevenueCat's API v2 uses Bearer token auth. Every request goes through https://api.revenuecat.com/v2/projects/{project_id}/. Offerings define what your app sells — query them directly.`,

An AI agent building and monetizing apps programmatically has no use for "Step 1: Open Xcode." This creates friction at the very first interaction.\n\nReproduction: Navigate to RevenueCat's getting-started documentation. Every quickstart guide begins with native SDK installation. There is no "API-first" or "headless" setup path. An agent must reverse-engineer the REST API flow from the API reference docs.\n\nAI agents building apps programmatically, agent-assisted development workflows, and CI/CD pipelines that need to configure subscriptions without human intervention.`,

These metrics are critical for growth experiments, automated reporting, and feedback loops. Currently, they're only accessible through the dashboard UI.\n\nAn agent needs to measure the impact of a growth experiment. The relevant metrics (trial conversion, MRR change) are in Charts. There is no REST API endpoint to query Charts data. The agent cannot close the feedback loop programmatically.\n\nGrowth-focused agents, automated reporting systems, any workflow that needs subscription metrics without a human opening the dashboard.`,

Agent-operated systems need stronger trust boundaries: signature verification, idempotency guarantees, and programmatic replay.\n\nConfigure a webhook endpoint in the RevenueCat dashboard. Receive events — but there's no signature verification mechanism documented for custom endpoints. If an event is missed (network issue, server downtime), there's no API to replay it. The agent must trust that all events arrived, with no way to verify.\n\nAgent-operated backends that process subscription events autonomously.`,
